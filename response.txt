I'd be happy to help you with your question about the Sigma web development course.

You're looking for information on where semantic tags are taught in this course. From what I've seen, semantic tags are actually covered in Video 11 of the course.

In that video, semantic tags are explained at several points in time. Specifically, they are introduced around the 40-second mark (Video 11, start: 40.36), and then further explained between the 55-60 second mark (Video 11, start: 56.56). They're also briefly mentioned again near the end of the video (around Video 11, start: 541.0).

If you'd like to learn more about semantic tags in the context of HTML, I would recommend watching Video 11 of the course. You can find it by searching for "Semantic Tags" or "HTML Semantic Tags" in the Sigma web development course platform.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
