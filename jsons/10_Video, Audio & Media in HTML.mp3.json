    "text": " In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video, and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening Open With Code by right-clicking. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video in an HTML file? How to put a video? How to put audio? How to put media? So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute. And it has some more attributes that I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to if you write here, then video.mp4 will play if you have it. I have video.mp4. So let's see here. I have put it here with ctrl. And I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Okay. Now this is a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px. I will only do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. We don't need to write px here either. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, I do one thing. I do height is equal to 555 so that it gets smaller. In fact, I make it smaller. I make it 255. And you see it came here. Okay. Now I play it because I can play it with ctrl. It's a good road from America now. What name did you tell? Gopi Indra Jogi. Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US. Name tell me. Gopindra Jogi. So what is it that you can play video like this. Now here are some attributes of the video tag. It is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have written ctrl. So these ctrls will come to you. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src. So you know that put a video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand. That is, if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else. So I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can also be on your server. It can also come from the third party. Now what does the ctrl do? Adds video ctrls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the Gopindra Jogi video. That you are getting to see the ctrls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees. What will be the ctrl add in your video? What will not be? Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. Okay. So if I put autoplay here. Suppose I put autoplay here. What are you doing? What is happening? So see. It's good. So you can see here that it is autoplay. Okay. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played. So it will keep looping. Like I show you. What are you doing? Gopindra Jogi. What are you doing? So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. Okay. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here. On codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something. Like downloading VS code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want when I record a video. If there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will make a video by scrolling like this. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute on your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you see it will look like this. Okay, this is how it looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. Okay, the thumbnail of the YouTube video is seen. This is exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. Width and height. You know that it specifies the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. Okay. So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very interesting quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio. Here comes SRC. And I have to put SRC in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put it in sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put SRC is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls. Then I will not see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a bad Sachin? Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it. Then it will not work. And I can also increase it. Is it a bad Sachin? Okay. You people have seen. So this is an audio called sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That we will see some attributes of this audio. SRC you know. Source of the video file. Okay. Then after this controls. You know. Play, pause or volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will play it automatically. If I have here. Autoplay. What is Sachin in Sachin? It will play automatically. Is it a bad Sachin? So what by autoplaying. It will play automatically. Our audio. After this. Next attribute. That is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat. If I want to loop it. Then I have autoplayed. And I loop it. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a bad Sachin? Once. What is Sachin in Sachin? Second time. Is it a bad Sachin? So you saw. It was repeated. Means once it was saved. Then after that it was saved again. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you people have seen this thing. Sachin.mp3. I have looped it. Is it a bad Sachin? So you people have seen this thing. I have looped this MP3. Means once it was played. Then it was saved. Then it was saved. Okay. What is Sachin? Sachin. Okay. It was repeated. Because this MP3. That will be played again and again. So there are many such cases. When you want. That this MP3. Is repeat. Okay. So if you want. That your MP3 is repeat. Then you can use it. Now. After this. What will mutate do? It will mute the audio. And definitely. You don't want. That by default. Your audio is mute. In most of the cases. But. If you want. That. The audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. That brother. Whoever wants to listen. Unmute it. Sachin. What is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user you want. Can play and see. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. In total. This is the thing. So. I hope. You have understood this thing. You must have enjoyed. You must have. This is the thing. I have explained it on the website. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not preload. The audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. If the browser fetches the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise. You will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. It means. That the browser. Only metadata. That is. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. That is. It will preload it. It will preload the information. It will preload it. It will preload it. And by doing this. The browser will preload. The entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do. It will download. And automatically. It will load. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This preload attribute is asked a lot. So you should know. What is the preload attribute? Before moving forward. I want you to share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we move forward in the videos. So. My request to you is. You like this video. And along with that. As you are forcing this repository. You should also star it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was about audio. And video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. And you should definitely use it. All these images. I will give you. So that you can try out this thing well. Now many people were asking. Can we use replit? So. I will tell you. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. See. I have not used replit in this course. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want. You can use it in the phone. If you want to run html. There is a replit app. There is also for iOS. There is also for Android. So you can try it out. Many people are asking. How to do coding in the phone. Replit. But what I want now. VS Code. Which most of the people. Want to use. Prefer. So I thought. Why not make videos in VS Code. But I personally use replit a lot. Infact. Videos also come in replit. So. I will tell you. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. So. I am not going to tell you. What is the topic. The next topic is. SVG. Media related. What is SVG. SVG is a format. With which you. Can create an image. With high graphics. Vector images. So if you copy. You can make a circle. In this. So SVG is used. In the same way. As. It is used. In our IMG tag. So see. If I put SVG here. So this SVG will come here. So see. This circular SVG. Came here. Video. Audio. SVG. So you can see. That this SVG. Is used. In the same way. In the same way. So. You can. See this. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. See. You have to add this. This is known as namespace declaration. So you have to add this SVG. And. Now you guys can see this SVG on here. So this thing is very important. And many people. In the future when you will make websites. Your own. So you will definitely get stuck in this problem. I keep getting stuck. So I am telling you. The problem in which you will get stuck. I told you earlier. You have not gotten a problem. I have also told you that the problem is going to come. And also told you the solution. Next topic is iFrames. iFrames is also a very simple thing. That with iFrames. You need to add another tab. To your particular webpage. I have told you that it is coming and also the solution Next topic is iframes Iframes is a very simple thing You can embed another website In your website Like if I want to embed this webpage I can use iframes Like this I will copy this url And paste it here And you can see That this website is Embedded in this iframe You definitely want to embed in a big iframe But if you want to embed You can embed it like this I will increase the height So width is equal to Let's say 122 and height is equal to 444 So it will look like this Now definitely it was coming in this width So it came in this line But if I increase the width 322 So you can see My website is completely embedded So you can embed a website Another use case of iframe Is youtube video If you want to share youtube video And click on embed It will give you iframe code And you can start it here If you want to start at a particular time You can do that here The point at which you will start and share That time comes here Like I want to start from here Like start the video from here So what I will do is click on share After clicking on share, I will click on embed I will start at 1219 And I will copy it And I will put it in my code So I will comment this iframe And I will put it in the iframe below Okay, I will do word wrap So that you can see the code properly So now what I will do After pasting it I will show you the document See this video is embedded here So I hope you understood this thing And Media is only this much in html Miscellaneous You will see a lot of things in every topic But pretty much that's all about Media, audio, video Media is only this much This is what you will use 95% of the times Now I will give you a quick quiz And your quick quiz is Create a website Which shows videos of different category And audios of different categories You can use YouTube videos YouTube videos in an iframe Using YouTube's embedding feature So what you have to do You have to make a website In which you will get a lot of content Now you can use video audio tags And YouTube's share feature The way I did YouTube video You can also embed here And make a very good website And show me If you want you can give me a comment And if you want You can also tell me the code So do attempt this And do write sigma batch op in the comment section Access this playlist Like this video And do write sigma batch op That's all for now Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Outro"
