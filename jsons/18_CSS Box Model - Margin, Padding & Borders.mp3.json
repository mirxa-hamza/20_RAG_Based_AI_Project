In any element, there is a content which is itself then margin, then border and then padding. This concept of box model is where is the border, margin and padding. In this video, we will understand all these things and see how margin, border and padding are set in CSS. So let's go to the computer screen. I am really very excited. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come inside my computer screen and the first thing I will do here is I will show you this playlist and you guys who do not click on the star here and do not access by clicking here you will not do that either. Do it, man, click on the star here and click here and access it. And I have also put the source code for you guys. Access it too. I want you to enjoy it too. Okay, so what do you guys do while enjoying it? The way I have made this folder here and what I will do by right-clicking shift I will make it open with code. As you can see, and this VS code will open for me. If your open with code option is not coming, which many people tell me that our open with code option is not coming. So I have a suggestion for you guys. What do you do? To install VS code again, run its setup again and see what options I have checked. Now I will come in the video and here by making a file in the name of index.html I will keep a boilerplate template and here I will write CSS box model. After writing the CSS box model, I will make a style tag here. With the help of which I will make you guys. Oops, how did I make a style tag? Is it too fast? Guys, no, it's not fast. Okay, it will work. So what will I do while making a style tag here? I will put styles here and tell you how does the box model work in CSS? So first of all, let's understand the concept of box model in CSS. What is the concept of box model in CSS? See, everything in CSS is box. Whatever elements we have made with HTML, they are all a box. Whether we make a container, whether we make a div, whether we make a span, they are all a box in our CSS. And there are some things in that box that I want to show you here. So if you can see on the computer screen, then you will see that here I have explained the concept of CSS box model. CSS box model means that padding is outside your content, this border is outside it, and margin is outside it. So you should know this concept. One more thing I want to tell you is that let's say I made a div.box here. Okay, I made a box here, I will write I am a box. And here I will show you its preview. So this box has been made by me by doing I am a box. There is already some margin and padding outside this box, which you will know when I put a background on it. So what I will do simply, I will write dot box here, which means that I selected the class selector box and I will say background color is let us say aqua. So the background color of this box will be aqua. We can do the format document by doing it rightly, so that we will get good formatting. Now you see here, there is already some margin padding in it. What I will do is using a universal selector, it happens that our browser plays a little smart from its side. It says that this developer does not have a brain, so I will put my brain a little. And it puts its brain and adds margin padding little by little. It adds many more styles. And that's why we sometimes need to reset CSS. So I wrote here star and wrote m-0 Sorry, I wrote m-0, so margin became 0. I wrote p-0, so padding became 0. These were emmet shortcuts. And what will happen by doing this, it will stick to the top. Like spacing was coming here, it is not coming now. So I wrote I am a box, so let's do one thing. Let's write I am a box. And here I write div.box and here I can add multiple classes. By doing box1, box2. So I made a box, made a box1. And in this, I made a box, and in this, I made a box, and a box2. So whatever I select the box and put the properties, it will also apply to this element and it will also apply to this. Because look, we can give multiple classes to one element. I told you before. Multiple classes can be given to one element. And here you can see that I have given it a box and given it a box1. I have given it a box and given it a box2. And I will simply write here I am another box. Okay, this is our box2. This was box1, this is our box2. Now what will I do inside box2, I will say dot box2 and dot box1. Now you understand what I did here. Look, first I will write that property which I want to give to both the boxes. Or suppose I have ten boxes like this. So I want to give it in the tenth of ten. I will write that as dot box. And some properties will be such that I individually want to give in box1 and box2. So what I will do, I will give box1 class to this and box2 class to this. And if any element has to give more than one classes, then we give it by putting space. Can we give more than one ID to any element? Tell me in the comment section below. Let me see how much understanding you have. Make two-way interaction and tell me in the comment section below. Can we put more than one ID in one element? By giving spaces. Tell me in the comment section below. We can also put classes by giving spaces. I confirm this and tell you. Everyone should have a comment. I don't know. Now here you see, I wrote dot box1. So what can I do, suppose I made the color yellow. Okay. I made the color yellow. What will happen by making the color yellow? By making the color yellow and I will make its color red. The font color will be yellow and the font color will be red here. I will show you. Here the font color is yellow and here the font color is red. Now what does the box model say? The box model says that the content of your CSS will be here. Outside it will be padding, outside it will be border and outside it will be margin. Okay. And the total height or width of any element will be added to all this. Total height and width. Total height means how much ever this place will be. So this thing should be known to you. In CSS box model, we have seen only this much. So I have put different classes here. Now what will I do? I will say inside box1, I will give some padding. And I want to give 10 pixel padding. So if I give 10 pixel padding, then 10 10 pixel padding will come from all sides. And to see this, you can right click and inspect. Look at this carefully. Look at this carefully. You see here that I right clicked and inspected. So here below you can see, I have removed my face for a while. I hope you can see box and box1. So here you can see box and box1. If I hover over box1, then only this element is selected. Look up. Look up. Look here. See this is selected. If I hover over this, then only box2 is selected. So by clicking on box1, this element is selected. I can come here. See this, I have removed it like this. Now by coming here, I can see all the things about it. Color yellow. If I want, I can change this color temporarily. I will only change it temporarily. Because its source code is written here. So whatever I will change here will be permanent. Whatever I will change here will be temporary. So now I will not do it as I am telling you that I can do temporary changes and preview that how it will look if my box color becomes white. If I reload it, then it will be fine again. And by selecting this box, I will come here on computed again. Now as soon as I come on computed, see I can see a box. And this box is exactly the same box that I have shown on codebedhari.com. So by this kind of box, you will know that this particular element of yours, that is box1, the width and height is how much and what is the padding in it. I have given padding of 10 from all four sides. There is no border. There is no margin. So in this way, we have given all these things in this element. Let's put a border in it. So till now I have put padding of 10. I am doing it in box1. Guys, just remember that I am working in box1 only. Coming back a little, now what I will do here is put margin. And I will put margin of 5 pixels. And as soon as I put margin of 5 pixels, what will happen is that it is outside the element. So the background of the element is not retained. What does this mean? It means that if I put pink color on you, if I put pink color on you, then you will be pink. But if I throw pink, pink, or anything else around you, then it will not be on you. So this was a very strange example. But let me tell you that the content outside this is padding. So if I give padding, then the background color comes in the padding area. Because padding is inside the content. And margin is outside the content. Which is outside your element. Content is inside the element. See this is the whole element. The content of the element is this. So the background our color will be in the padding area. It will not be in the margin area. You have to keep this in mind. So here I have given margin. So you see the margin of 5 has come. Now I will tell you how to add border. If I write border here, and I will tell you about border later. But for now, understand that if I write border 2px solid blue, then the border of 2px has come here. And here you see that I have given the border of 2px. You can see that the border has come here. So this border is visible to you here. And you can see here that this is my content and this is the border. So what happens here is that there is a DPI factor in our display. Because of which the actual border you will get to see separately. But this is pretty much that how you can see margin, border, and padding in real time of your element. So I hope you understood this thing. Now I tell you here that how the width of your element is calculated. Now assume that I have given the width of this element let us say or I give its height, let us say 200px of this element. So I gave its height 200px and its height is 200px. Now I will inspect and show you one thing. And I take you to the computed values. So see its height is 200px. And you can see that as I put an arrow on the content it is showing the content, padding is showing the padding border is showing the border margin is showing the margin. Now you can see here that the element its actual height is 200px. Then 10 will be added to it and 10 will be added from below it will become 220. Then after this borders will be added. Then margin will be added. So as I will add all these things to it, then all this space will come out. But the height of a particular element or how much width is there. So total width and total height is taken out from this formula. What we do is we will add both left and right padding to width. Both left and right border and both left and right margin. This is total width, that means how much space will be there with the margin element. I hope you are understanding this thing. And if I talk about the element only, that how much space is there till the border, then you will add this whole thing. But now I want to tell you one thing here that if I put a CSS property here which I can directly put from here. I can add any CSS property here. I will show you this too. If I make the background red, then its background will be red temporarily until I reload. But I will put it here. What I will do here I will write here box sizing and I will write here border box. As soon as I write here box sizing, border box you will see here that its actual width, sorry height is 176. 176.8 is because 176.8 plus 20 is 196.8 and after that the border will be 200. We don't include margin here because margin is outside. Margin is not included when we set a height and here we give box sizing property. Try to understand when I say its height is 200 or width is 200. So with width 200, if I don't put box sizing border box, listen to this carefully. Listen to this very carefully. If I don't put box sizing border box, then what will happen? Then the actual content will be its height or if I talk about width then it will be 200. I will explain you with the example of height. 200 will be the height of its content. Then if you talk about the total space then padding will be added to it. Then the border will be added to it. But if I say box sizing border box, so I am basically saying that the 200 height I have told you is by including border and padding. But margin is not included. I am telling 200 by including border and padding. Where I have done box sizing border box, it means that the height of my element that I have written here is my height, border and padding. I have written both of them together. That is, by combining both of them, content plus border plus padding should be 200. When I say box sizing border box, I am saying this. So everyone tell me in the comment that if we write box sizing border box, then what am I saying? I am saying to CSS that hey CSS God, the height I am giving you, this height I am giving by combining padding and border. That is, content plus border plus padding, that is 200. This is the meaning of my height. So in a way, box sizing border box changes the definition of height. What is the definition of height? The definition of height is that padding will not be included in it, border will not be included in it. You can see here that this is 176, I will remove it from here. By the way, I can also remove it from here temporarily. If I uncheck the box sizing border box, then see its height is 200. And then I added this to it, then I added this to it. After combining both of them, its total height will be 200 plus 20, 220 plus borders, whatever is calculated, that is sum. But here I want to tell you one thing that if I say box sizing border box, then what happens that as soon as the box sizing border box is written, its height here will be reduced by 200. And it will be adjusted in this way that it will come by combining padding and border. I hope that makes a lot of sense. I hope I explained it to you. So this was a very important concept that I wanted to tell you all. And now the concept I am going to tell you, you will enjoy it. You will enjoy it because I will tell you about margin collapse. And this concept you should definitely know. So I will take you back to the computer screen. This was our code. How much margin did I give here? 5 pixel margin. Suppose I give exactly the same things in border 2. And let's increase the margin a little. To make it fun, let's make it 25 pixels. So that the spacing increases. And suppose I keep the same to same things, just the color of the other element same to same things. And I will also make its border black. So that it looks a little different. The rest of the values are the same. You can see in this box too. Now you tell me honestly that the margin around this box is 10 10 10 10. The margin around this box is 10 10 10 10. So here we should have seen this space double from this space or not? Think again and tell me. That look around this, the margin around it is, if I select this element and show you, then 25 25 25 25. Sorry, it's not 10 10, it's 25 25. Okay, 25 25 25 25. This element is also around it. 25 25 25 25. So this distance should be 50. Look, 25 is this much. Look at my arrow above. And this is also 25. So this is also 25. Why is it not 50? The upper element should also be there. Here comes the concept of margin collapse. What is this concept of margin collapse? The concept of margin collapse says that if the margin of two elements is overlapping, then the maximum margin will be applied only once. Like if I give a margin of 25 here and a margin of 25 here. What is the maximum of 25 and 25? It is 25. Both are equal. So the margin of 25 will be applied only once. If I make one of them 35, then the margin of 25 will be applied only once. So this difference will be 35. So this is called margin collapse. So if I show you a good example of margin collapse in images, I hope I will get a good image from which I can explain margin collapse. So basically what happens is if I have a box A and a box B, I think this image is very good to explain this concept. Like I have a box A and a box B. I have given a margin of 30 pixels in box A and 20 pixels in box B. So it will not look like this, but it will look like this. Because the maximum of these two will be applied only once in both. Between the two. So this is how the margin will be applied here. You understand this is called margin collapse. So I hope you understood this concept. What is margin collapse? What is the box model of CSS? How does the box model work? And I tried to explain it to you very well. What is the concept of margin collapse? Which troubles a lot of CSS developers. I know people like this. Who tell me that has CSS gone bad? What has happened? Why is my margin looking wrong? Without saying all these things, understand the concept of margin collapse. And once you understand the concept of margin collapse, then you will enjoy it. Then your development will be so smooth. When do you have to put a box sizing border box? What will happen if you put it? What will happen if you don't put it? Especially when we convert Figma files into HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Then you will get a lot of work. Whether to put box sizing or not. I hope you are enjoying this course. And I hope you are understanding all these things well. If you have not accessed this playlist yet, then do access it.
