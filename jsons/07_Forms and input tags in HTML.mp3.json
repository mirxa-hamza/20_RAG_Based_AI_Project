    "text": " In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form. Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server. These are the forms that you see on contact pages, Google forms or inquiry forms. On flight or railway ticket, the date and time, where to go and all these details are also submitted through the HTML forms. In the last video, very few people liked it. I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So let's go to the computer screen, see about the forms, see about the input tags and see some best practices. Let's roll the intro. Intro So guys, I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here quickly whose name I am going to keep video 6 because this is the 6th video. I will do it with open with code. I have already told you all this and here I am going to make it quickly. Index.html and by putting an exclamation mark in it, what will I do? I will wrap the view and I will turn on the screen cast mode and you will see here. I will write forms let's learn it. Okay, so I have set the title of this page here and what happened by setting the title? The title will be visible on our page in actual. Here I want to tell you a very important setting, show preview. Many of you have also pointed out to me in the comment that you have to click so many times, can you do something? Yes, you can click on the gear below, click on settings and after clicking on settings, what you do simply, write live preview here, live preview and we can actually set it such that whenever we click, it will open on the external browser. Okay, so now see I will close everything, as soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser and I come to my browser and the playlist of the Sigma web development course is accessing it by clicking on the star and here on the bookmark. But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, you see it opened. So if you want this, then do this, but sometimes what happens is that you also want to prefer side by side view and when would you like to do that? When you are actually working on a design using HTML, CSS, so whenever you are working on design, definitely you will want to see live preview here, which is why this extension was made and it was made different from the live server, so that you can see the preview on the side, now what we will do here, we will know about the forms, what is a form? You know the name, form means like a railway form, we fill it and our reservation is made, along with that, we fill the form of IIT JEE, the form of NEET, the form of any exam, so that our data can reach those who want it, okay, so this is the form. HTML is a form tag, as soon as you write the form, you will hit enter, in this way, the first question will ask you what is the action of your form, get or post? I will tell you a very quick difference between get request and post request, that we will see this thing later when we will read the backend, get request is a very simple request and post request is when we send, in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data, like whenever our form will be posted, then in most of the cases we will use post request, and get request is a very simple request that we have to tell the server something, and that's it, or we have to hit the server with a request, that's it, but if you don't understand this thing, that should be fine, there is no problem, we will do this in detail later, so form action is equal to post, I have written here, now I can show some input tags in it, I will tell you what are input tags, that what elements will come in your form, like you can put date, you can put in the form, you can say name, you can say phone number, you can say what is your age, it can be just a number, you will want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you that the input tag that you put in the form, and there is a label tag that is used to label that input, so what I will do here, you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text, so I will put the type is equal to text input here, and you see here, if I zoom out and show you, so see here input type is equal to text, name is equal to username, placeholder is enter your username, and it will look something like this, that is, you can say here enter your username, and the user in front of you will have to enter the username, I will write an H1 here, and I will write here, let's say form to apply for TA, for sigma web dev TA, sigma web development course TA, we are hiring teaching assistants for the sigma web development course, so we can write something like this here, by the way I have put subtitles, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it, and along with that I show you one more thing, so these subtitles are very funny, I will show you, write sigma batch op and your village land, and give your village land to me, means if any English person is watching this, or if someone is watching this who does not know Hindi at all, he will say, what happened so far, and give your village land to me, it is very easy to see this thing, now you can see here that I have put H1 here, which is our heading, this is our main heading, enter your username, this is our input tag, along with the input tag, we use the label tag, now whose label is this, so I will write its ID, means I will write its ID username, and what I will do in for is equal to, I will put its ID in for is equal to, now what is this ID, I will tell you later, for now you just understand that it is a unique identifier of an element, to identify this element uniquely, like your Aadhar number cannot be anyone else, in the same way, it has got this ID username, now it cannot be anyone else, this is the ID, I will tell you more in detail later, but for now understand this, so I wrote label for is equal to username, I wrote this input, and you can see here, that the label will come here, so I am seeing here, I have not put anything in the label actually, so I will put enter your username, and you can see that as soon as I put this here, you will see here, enter your username, after this you can enter your username here, along with that you can put anything here, suppose I want to ask here what is your gender, so I can do something like this here, and you can see enter your gender, and as soon as I did this, I can ask you what is male or female, now what happens here, sometimes we wrap this in div, what is div, div is our block element, and what are inline and block elements, I have not told you in this course yet, but I will tell you in the coming videos, so for now you just understand that I am putting this in div to give a new space, so as soon as I put this in div, it will come in a new space, yes, there is also a br tag, there is also a br tag with which line break comes, but I don't prefer br tag, and you will get to know why, why we don't want to bloat our html with br tag, you will get to know this in the coming videos, now you see here, enter your username, here male or female, what is it, now you see here, as soon as I click on female, this radio button is selected, I am clicking on male, this is selected, why is this happening, because the label of this, I have put for is equal to female, and here I have put id female, you see, and along with that, you see, I have put the same name of both of them, here name is equal to gender, I have put this input tag also, and name is equal to gender, I have put this input radio tag also, and as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, it means this is a radio button, and if we have made its name same, then only one of these two can be selected at a time, that is, if I select this, then only this will happen, if I select this, then only this will happen, now I will show you one thing, if I mess up the id in the form of the label, and here also in the form, I don't mess up in the first one, and if I mess up in the second one, then when I click on the female of the second one, see it will not be selected, I am clicking, it is not being selected, I am clicking on male, it is being selected, so to select the female, I have to click on this, you see, so what I should do, always for is equal to, the input tag, its id should be put, so you can see, here I have put the label for is equal to female, along with that, we have an input tag, which is type is equal to checkbox, now see here, if I put the input of type is equal to checkbox, I will do this work by putting it inside div, and when I do the format document by right clicking, our document will be very good, that is, its formatting, indents, etc. will be very good, now you see here, here I can check subscribe to newsletter, and the difference between radio button and checkbox is that, you can check the checkbox, different checkboxes, here if you want male or female, or any of the options, you can select it like this, after this we have text area, and select tag, and I will show you what it is, so text area and select tag, it works like this, now here, as soon as you copy the text area, and I will show you by putting it here, so text area input type is equal to text, but it has rows and column attribute, which helps you to make its size small, now you see here, the placeholder inside it, I have given, enter your comment here, so I have given the text inside it, ideally, we will keep it empty, or we will not give at least new line in it, so I will stick it here, now it will reach to the left side, I will show you, so it has reached to the left side, see enter your comment here, and any user can put his comment here, now you see I have put the content of text area, enter your comment here, so ideally you will not want to do this, you will want to keep the text area empty, and you want to put a label, and you can say label for is equal to comment, and definitely we will put id here, whenever we put for, so inside for, the element for which it is, its id, now you see here, enter your comment, if I write here, what will happen, enter your comment, if I write enter your comment, now you will say, this is not styled properly, so this style is not properly, because we will style it with CSS later, for now I will put just br tag, but I don't recommend br tag, I am telling you again, I don't recommend br tag, because br tag has problems, by the way you should know br tag, it is a line break tag, a line break comes from it, so you must be thinking, what is the problem in br tag, but I will tell you, br tag is something that I don't recommend, it is not that you don't want to use it, but I don't recommend using it all the time, the easiest thing is, people think, put br tag and add new spaces, I oppose this thing a lot, so I will copy this, I will show you select tag, something like this, and you see here, as soon as I put select tag here, so in select, you get some options, the syntax of select is something like this, make apple, and you can use any of the three, now you see here, any of the three can be used, and here I did value is equal to apple, first I made select tag, then option value is equal to apple, option value is equal to banana, option value is equal to cherry, when we will parse this form data, then I will tell you in javascript part, how to take this data and send it to the server, so about the form, there are many things that are remaining, so stay tuned for that, this was about the forms, I wanted to tell you all the elements of the form in this video, and along with that, I have told you all the things, about the form, the rest of the attributes, like action, I told you, you can submit form on any page, and where it will handle the form, so you can give that data here, then the method is get request or post request, I will tell you the difference in these two in the coming videos, but I have told you in a very rough way, that get request is a very simple request, post request is used when you have to send big data to the server, because get request has a limit, in post request you can send a lot of data, in get request we don't even send passwords, we send it with the help of post request, now here, I have told you the method, what happens in name, name is equal to username, we mark it with name, so the server will know, which key value is this, so the key value that will go to the server, will go according to the name, now we will do server side processing, placeholder means, what will be written inside it, here enter your username, if I click on it, then it will not say enter your username, but it will say enter your username, it is telling me here, that I have to put username in it, then required means, you have to require it, otherwise your form will not be submitted, so we will use this a lot, then we have autofocus, what does autofocus do, it automatically focuses the cursor, so I will show you the magic of autofocus, so if you have written autofocus in the input tag, so I have written autofocus in the username, now I will reload it, so if I type on it, then it will automatically focus on it, so autofocus means, that whenever you type, it will be typed here, I hope you are understanding these things, now validation attributes, I have told you the requirement, in which you can give regular expression pattern, now don't get confused, don't say what are you talking, we don't know regular expression, so I am sitting here to teach you all, but you understand that we will accept only one particular pattern, if we have put pattern is equal to this, then you can't put anything other than this pattern, so this thing you should know here, so I hope you are enjoying this video, and with that, in the comment section, do write sigma batch op, please review this course, because still many people ask me, whether this course should be done or not, it is a free course, so people don't value it, they say this course is free, so we should watch it or take a paid course, and I would like to give a note for those people, who told me that we took a paid course, what should we do now, we should collect that money or join sigma batch, you should join sigma batch, cut your losses and join sigma batch, because what is the quality of this course, I don't think I need to tell you, so you should come and do this, you will get everything here, I am telling you, I am not saying it is free, I was going to sell you this course for 10,000 rupees, that was the amount we fixed, I was going to sell this course for 10,000 rupees, and I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course, if anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong in selling any course, but the thing is, if you have bought any other course, and you still feel that sigma is a very good course, which is there, then you should join, if you make your career, then you will not feel anything in the future, if you look back in the future, then you will also say that we took a paid course, then we took a free course, and if you make your career, then all these things will not matter in the future, so do what is right for you, and you work while understanding your right and wrong, I hope you are understanding things, so like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel, and write sigma batch op in the comment section below, and do give me your name in the comment section, that's all for now, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time.
