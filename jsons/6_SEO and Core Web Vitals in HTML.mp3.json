    "text": " In today's video, we will learn about Core Web Vitals and why they are important. Like this video and keep your energy high. The thing is that your website should run on all devices in iPad, iPhone, Android, Surface Pro 4. Because we have to give a good experience to all users through our website. In this video, we will also learn that there is a hidden tool in Chrome called Lighthouse. And how you can use it to enhance your website. So write in the comment section below, Sigma Batch OP. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And now I will make a new folder whose name is Video 6. Video 6. And here in Video 6, I will open VS Code as always. And the thing I am going to tell you today is very important from the aspect of SEO. First of all, I want to tell you what is SEO? SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. If you see any website, it has SEO in it. Let's take the example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in. So Amazon.in wants this website to be loaded as soon as possible. So that their products can come in search. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users. So Google wants to show only those pages that are fast. They present the information very well. And along with that, there are some things in them that the user has a good experience. For example, let's say there are two pages. One page has told about dog food. The other page has also told exactly the same thing about dog food. But the page 2 of these two is loaded very fast. It loads well. So Google will give it more preference. Along with that, there are core web vitals. Which Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, content is important. What is on your page? If your content is good, then maybe your website can rank without core web vitals. But if you are competing with a page that has presented almost similar quality content. Then your core web vitals will be seen. And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in the core web vitals is your CLS. You see this video here. Which I have run from the web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website. And he is trying to cancel the order here. And by mistake, the time he canceled, this thing above became visible. And he shifted the layout. And the order was completed. But the user wanted the order to be incomplete. He wanted to click on no. In this case, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, it should not be like this. That's why our CLS should be as low as possible. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means how much is shifting while the page is loading. Assume that you have loaded the page. And first of all, you get to see this. It was above first. And after that, when this key term part was loaded. So everything shifted down. Layout should not shift. If you put width and height in images, then the layout will not shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint. This means that if the user is viewing a page. Then the biggest element on it. For example, the biggest part in this is this image. How long is it loading? Means the whole page will be loaded. But the biggest looking element, which is the most important. How long is it loading? If we assume web.dev and Google, a good LCP score should be 2.5 seconds. Means the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for First Input Delay. First Input Delay means that if any user. If you click on any input element like a button. Or any kind of input on a page. So how long does that input process? For example, if you click on a button. So how long does that button click browser process? And if we assume Google and web.dev. So your input should start processing in less than 100 milliseconds. So these were the three core web vitals which are very important. For your information, these core web vitals are also updated. But these three are very important and you should know. Now I will show you what is the lighthouse report? And why do they generate? And how will these three core web vitals get value from there? So I tell you here. If you inspect by right-clicking. And you may be coming to the right side. So you can click here and bring it down. By clicking here. If you want, you can bring it here again. And by clicking here, you can bring it down. I prefer it down. Because I have a habit of looking down from the starting. Now you can see the option of lighthouse here. Lighthouse basically generates a report for you. And tells you what can be improved in your HTML page. For example, if I want to see here on mobile. How mobile users see my website. So I will click on mobile. Or I will click on desktop. I will close this tab. I will click on mobile. And I will click on analyze page load here. So this will generate a report for me. You can see here that a report has been generated. In this, performance, accessibility, best practices, SE and PWA. All these things are being shown. Now here you can see that some things are shown in red. That is, the scope of improvement is in the page. Now here you are telling that size your images properly. Your website can be loaded 2.7 seconds fast. So all these suggestions are given to you. By lighthouse. And if you incorporate these suggestions. Then your website will be loaded very well. And will give a good experience to the user. Now you can see here that image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. So you should use the width and height attribute of the image. Which we read in the last video. So that your browser has space. When we set width and height in HTML. Then the space is reserved in the browser. Otherwise, if we do not set height and width. Then what will happen is that our browser will not know. How much space to reserve. And as long as CSS will load. The whole page will shift from bottom to top. So we don't want our page to shift in loading time. If our page starts shifting. So if we are going to click here. So when it will shift by mistake. It is possible that we will click here. Suppose an image was going to come here. I am going to click here. And as long as I clicked. This image was loaded during that time. And all this content shifted down. And instead of clicking here by mistake. I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer at all. And this should be the least. You can see that the space is very less. Cumulative layout shift. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift at least. So that our user can get a very good experience. So here we get a lot of suggestions. And this is for our mobile. Now we can generate a desktop report. So the desktop report will be generated. So as you can see. It has generated a report. 92 marks in performance. 100 out of 82 in accessibility. 75 in best practices. Now you see here. The good things that have been told here. And the scope of improvement that Lighthouse tells you. So this is a hidden tool. Which we should all use. Now I want to tell you about meta tags and meta description. So what I will do here. I will make a file. I will name it index.html. And after making an HTML file. The first SEO element I want to tell you. That is the title. If your title is reflecting the content of your page. So this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page is changing. You make the title in such a way. That it reflects the content of your page. Because if you want your website on Google. Then it will come according to the title. The index of Google. Like you guys write here. Code with Harry. Okay. And you write like this. So this thing is the title of the page. And this is the title of the page. Which is put by YouTube. This is the title of the page. Which is put by Instagram. This is the title of the page. Which is put by GitHub. So if the title is put on the page. And the title actually. Which reflects the content of your page. Truly. Then your website will rank very well. Now let's say I put content here. And I put an h1. And I write here Harry. And after that. Let's say I write a paragraph here. And I write here Lorem 45. Now why did I write Lorem 45? I will wrap the view word. Why did I write 45? Because this is a Google page. And I want to make a page. And I want to make a page. And I want to make a page. And I want to make a page. So I have written 45. Because I am lazy. And 4 and 5 are around. So I have reduced 4 and 5. I also write 23. Because they are also around. Okay. So there is no other reason. Now I will quickly preview it here. I will open in browser. So see this is how it looks. Now this document is written. If I leave it like this. Then this will not be a good SEO practice. I will write here about Harry. And I will write here code with Harry. Which is also my website. Okay. And what will happen by doing this? That my title will be written here. And I will put here. And I will put here. And I will put here. And I will put here. And I will put here. And I will put here. Okay. And what will happen by doing this? That my title will be reflected here. As you can see. So what will happen by doing this kind of work? That my website will have more chances to be seen in Google. By inspecting. I will also take out its light house report. And I will see what are the scope of improvements. Now its light house report will be very big. Because there is nothing in it. Which I should improve. But when I will put images etc. Then I will get suggestions. Like put width. Put height. Along with that. I will tell you one more trick. So that you can do your website in any mobile. How to do it. So I will tell you. So I will tell you. So I will tell you. So I will tell you. I will tell you one more trick. So that you can do your website in any mobile. How to do it. How to do it. You will get to know. So you click here. Can you see here computer? Click on this. And after this. If you choose responsive in it. Then you can see. Whatever kind of device. How your website will be seen. So your website is responsive or not. You can see it here. By doing this. If you want to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website will be in iPhone 12 Pro. The resolution is like this. Now don't say. Why there is no 15 or 16? Why there is no 12. But you can see the 12 in it. And you can see it in any device. Now don't ask why there is no 15 or 16, 12 pro means big iphone device, understand, in such a big device, how will your website look, this is simply being told to you, so now you can see how it will look in surface pro 7 by clicking here, how it will look in google phones, you can also find out, and if you want to take a general view, you can see how your website will look in any device, for example, in an ipad, if you don't have a device, then you can choose a responsive device and find out the approximate width of your device, in total, your website should look good in all the width devices, I will also tell you how this happens in this course, now if you click here again, then it will stop, the responsive view will stop, and as soon as it stops, your website looks like this, I will close it, I will come back here, now I will tell you about meta tags, here I will write meta, then you will see meta desc, I will click on meta desc, and here I can give the description of my page, let's say I give this is the page, this is a page about, this is a page which contains description about harry, and here you can write whatever page content you want, let's say you write what is seo, and here you can see this page has this meta description, now it is not necessary that a search engine will parse your meta desc, if it likes it, then it will keep it here, if you have not put meta desc, then it can be generated from your content, so this is the responsibility of the search engine, we don't know what bing will do, but our page should be to the point, especially if we are writing a blog and we want our page to rank organically, so here you can see that I have put meta desc, now a meta keyword used to be very popular, but now the meta keyword has been deprecated, the meta keyword is not used at all, the code of meta keywords looks like this, but it is believed that meta keywords do not rank in SEO at all, because people abuse it more, let's say you have written a page about pets and you have written what is SEO in the meta keyword, so it is not that your page will be ranked, I will correct these double quotes here, so if I put meta keywords here, then it is not necessary that the search engine will consider it, some search engines do not believe in meta keywords, they say that we do not want to see your meta keywords, so meta keywords used to be popular, but now it is not, now the content of your page is being parsed, and now the time of AI is coming, so your content will be understood, what value your content is giving, it will be understood, it will be ranked accordingly, now if you want to know exactly about these core web vitals, for example, if I right click and inspect and go to the lighthouse and take out the lighthouse report for the desktop, then some core web vitals come, like LCP comes, then FCP comes, first contextual paint, now you can see that everything is 100, 100, 100, 100, now there was not much in this content, but here you can see that what is being done to you, pages with websocket cannot enter back forward cache, this is websocket because we are using this extension, live preview, otherwise this is absolutely correct, accessibility is also 100, everything is 100, this is a very good page, PWA is progressive web apps, which we will not make now, but you see here that first contextual paint, largest contextual paint, total blocking time, cumulative layout shift, speed index, if you want to know about all this, like what is first contextual paint, that the user who is going to see it, how long has it been painted on the browser, so if you want to see this thing, then you will have to go to web.dev, web.dev is a very good website, which talks about all this, and you can see here that they keep talking about it, you can learn about all these things here, what is what, if you want to learn PWA, then you can learn PWA, there is a lot of good content about all these things, but we will focus on making HTML, CSS, JavaScript and websites in this course, this thing should have come according to me, because of which I told you about it, if you have not yet accessed the Sigma web development series, then do access it, then access the playlist and bookmark it, or click on the star and click here and save it, that's it for now, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time. Thank you."
