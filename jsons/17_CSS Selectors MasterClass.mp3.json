Now, what kind of elements can we apply style on and how can we select those elements? For example, element with an id, element with a class, we can target the element by its name. And we can also decide that if there is a particular type of element in a particular type of element, then only the styling is applied. I will explain the rules of applying this styling in this video and will explain selectors to you. If you are enjoying this course, then do write sigma patch op in the comment section below. We have to maintain high energy throughout the course. I want to give you a heads up that this video is very important. This is a very important video of CSS. So increase your excitement. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen and the first thing I am going to do is to make a folder of video 17. And video 17 is one of the most important videos of CSS. Because if you understand how selectors work, then your work will be very easy. So I will make it here with the name video 17. I will make index.html here. And I am going to use the internal CSS here. I will not make a style sheet. So that you can see how I am doing whatever I am doing. And here I will do a lot of things. I will turn on Word Wrap. I will turn on Screencast Mode. So that whatever button I press, you will know. And I will write CSS selectors here. And I will make a div here. And I made a simple div here. I wrote I am a div here. Guys, if you have not accessed it yet, then do play the playlist of Sigma Web Development. And the source code is getting updated. So you should not have any tension in that regard. Now what I am going to do here is a very simple thing. I will preview it first. And I want to make the background of this div red. Now you will say, why do you want to make the background of this div red? Because I want to know how much space this div is taking. That's why I want to make it red. So I want to make it red. So I will simply give the background of this div red. So I will say, I will put a style tag here. I will say that the background of the div should be red. Now this is our property, this is the value. I will tell you about other properties and values. But for now, you understand that this is the property and this is the value. So what I did here was an element selector. So I write here, element selector. And I will comment it here. So in CSS, comments are written like this. Here forward slash, star, and then star, forward slash. Whatever we write in the middle of the star, those are comments in CSS. So I put a CSS comment that this is an element selector. You will see here that the background of this div has turned red. This was our element selector, a very basic selector. Now what are the drawbacks of the element selector that I made here? The drawbacks are that the moment I add another div here. So what will happen, the background of this div will also turn red. And it is possible that you do not want to make the background of this div red. So if you do not want to make the background of this div red, then what will you do? Definitely you will use some other type of selector here. And you will want to use a specific selector. So I can say that do one thing, where the class is red, only that div should be red. So I made class is equal to red here. Now because I have made class is equal to red here, you will get to see what? If I write here dot red, and after this if I make the background color red, and let's say I comment this out, I do not want all the divs to turn red. So I will show you here that only this div will be red. As you can see here. So that's why I used class selector here. So this was our class selector. I will write here class selector. After this, the next selector I am going to tell you is id selector. And you must have guessed it as soon as you heard id selector. Let us say I want the id with hashtag red, or let's do one thing, let's make an id with hashtag green. And if I write here background color green, then wherever I will give id green, it will be green. Now here you can see that our I am another div, it has no color, there is no background color, but as soon as I give it id green, I will show you. I will write here, I will give id to this one, green, and you can see that in green id, I have given background color green, so its background color will be green. So this is our id selector. It was very simple, right? Yes, it is simple. We make things simple. Now I will tell you what child selector is. And the source code, this will work as a note. So what is child selector? If I want the paragraph in a div to turn blue, so I say the color of the paragraph in the div should be blue and what should be the background color? Assume that its background color is brown. Assume that I want this. So if I put a paragraph in any div, I am a para inside div, so what will happen? This selector will be applied. Child selector. Because this is the child of div, this paragraph is the child of div, and I have said that if any paragraph of div is child, then what will happen? So its background will be brown and will be blue. As simple as that. Now I will show you one thing. Assume that I wrap this whole thing in a div. Actually I will span it, not div. I will make it main, or I will put some other element here. Let us say I use article tag here. So now this paragraph is not in div, now this paragraph is in div, Now if paragraph is in article, then this property will not be applied. Now this property is not applied. Because this selector means if it is directly in div, then what will happen? This selector will be applied. Otherwise it won't be. Here this direct child is not there. Article is in div, then P. This is not the direct child of div. But if I want that if paragraph is a descendant of any div, then this property will be applied. Then I have another way. I will show you what I will do. I will say I will use descendant selector. And what is descendant selector? Descendant selector is simply we write something like this. I will write div, then I will write a space, and then I will write P. I am saying that P should be in div, no matter who it is. Whether it is in div, article, main, footer. It should be in div. In some form. It should be descendant of div. So you can see here that this property is applied. But when I talk about child selector, then child selector should be direct child. I hope you are getting it. Now there is another one. Universal selector. Suppose I want to give margin to all elements. And padding to all. I will write P0. I can write padding 0. It means that all elements have margin 0 and padding 0. Earlier there was margin and padding which was given by default by Google Chrome. But now this margin and padding is over. Like you have seen. I hope you have understood this. There are many types of selectors. But these are the most used selectors. Now I will tell you about more selectors in the coming videos. But these are the ones with which we will do our web development. So that you can learn more about these selectors. So I want you to pay attention to this. This is the most important. 99% of the websites are made through this. So let's focus on this. I hope you have understood this. You have understood this very well. There is one more selector which is also important. It is pseudo selectors. What is this pseudo selector? Suppose I have a link. I will write it down. I will write universal selector. Universal selector. Universal selector. What is this? Why is the comment not working? Now I will simply write pseudo pseudo Yes, I know it is pseudo. Don't write in the comment that it is pseudo not pseudo. It is pneumonia not pneumonia. I know that the P is silent. So why did you put it silent? Tell me in the comment section. Tell me in the comment section if you have knowledge about this. But now I will share my knowledge with you. And that is pseudo selectors. Now suppose I have a link. I have a link. LINK Now I will write https://www.google.com And I will write Go to Google. And It is very good. You will ask what is new in this. I want the color to be let us say white. No, I won't keep white. I want it to be yellow. So I want A visited A visited What should be the color of it? Yellow. So I will make the color yellow. Will the color be yellow? Yes. So if I want the anchor text to be yellow after the visit then I can use the pseudo selector. So here you can see the color changing. After this if you link a colon. That link which has not been visited. And suppose you want the color to be green. So if I put any link what will be the color? Suppose I do it like this Go to Facebook. And yes, let's capitalize the G of Google. So will the color be green? No, it won't be green. Maybe I have already visited Facebook. Sorry, I have visited Google. So I have to write Facebook here too. So I won't write Facebook. What will happen if I do Facebook 2? Yes, if I do Facebook 2, then see I have not visited it. I have visited Facebook. If you remember, in the initial few lectures. So that's why it is showing like this. Now I will tell you about two more links related. And I tell you that if you type any pseudo selector, then it shows you in the suggestion. Now if I want the background color of the active A to be red. So as soon as I click on any link, its background color is red. So active means when you are clicking. So see here, the Google.com page is coming. And as soon as I click, its background will be red. Yes, I know that ideally you don't want to use background color red. But that was just an example. To show you how it happens. For me, the easiest thing is to make the background color red. You will know this directly. Now after this, what else do we have apart from anchor tag? Some pseudo selectors, the answer is yes, definitely. One is hover. If I want to hover on anchor tag. And I want its background color to be red. Or the background color should be yellow. I make its background color yellow. So if I hover, you can see here. That here its background color is turning yellow. As soon as I hover. I have written here a hover. So these were some pseudo selectors. Now I will tell you one more pseudo selector. And that will be if I want to have a div whose class is selector. And I will write I am selector. Here I will put its name as one. So that you don't get confused with the selector. So here I will tell you about first child pseudo selector. Which will be a little tricky for you. So whatever I am telling you, these are pseudo selectors. So this pseudo selector of first child, if I write P first child background color aqua. It means that wherever P is the first child of its parent, there its background color will be aqua. Like in this case, you can see I have put a main tag here. And it is written here P I am first, then it is written P I am second. So here you can see that wherever the first child of main is P, which is here. This P is the first child of parent. So in this, this class will be applied. So see here its background is aqua or not. But I will tell you again that such things are very little used when you do web development. So you guys are such pseudo classes, do more research about them. What I will do in the description that I will put links about such other things. So the additional reading material, if you want to see more pseudo classes, then its link will be in the description. I will put it in the pinned comment. And if I forget, then you please remind me that you have not given the link. So I will give all the links to you. From there you can read about such selectors. But now we will move forward in this course and we will read about the main things. Because we have to come on projects very soon and make good real world apps. And after that we have to do backend and database. So we have to build a little pace here. I hope that you are enjoying this course.
