The concept of ID and Classes is one of the most confused concepts. In fact, when I was learning HTML, I was very confused in my early days. ID means Unique Identifier. That is, if you give an ID to an element, you will not give that ID to the other element. But Class means that if you want to give a property to multiple elements, then you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class named Red to a div and a form. Similarly, you can give a class named BGRed to an article tag and a header tag. Do like this video because we will now go to the computer screen and we will see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I am back. And if you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development course, then access the playlist by clicking on the bookmark and clicking on save. And the source code is also being uploaded on GitHub. Now I will come here in the folder and quickly make a folder for video 9. So I will make a folder for video 9. I will write here video 9. And after making the folder for video 9, I will right click and open with code. And here you can see that it has opened in BS code. Now I will write index.html here, I will enter with an exclamation mark. And along with that, now I will tell you what are ID and classes. You must have an Aadhar card, right? If not, then you must have some ID. Now don't write in the comment that I don't have an ID. Whenever you go somewhere, you have to show your ID to prove your identity in some of the cases. That I am this. Now if you want to understand about ID and classes in HTML, then ID is the same as your identity. Okay, what is it? It is your identity. So listen to a story here. This is John. And this is Harry. These two are very good friends. They are very good friends. They just don't share their lunch. And the rest are very good friends. In the matter of food, he is not the one. And he is a friend in all other matters. And here you can see that John and Harry have their own Aadhar card ID. So this is my Aadhar number. And John's Aadhar number looks something like this. So this is John's Aadhar number. And this is my Aadhar number. Our Aadhar numbers can never be the same. Or if our friends are made. Suppose my friend is Tanya and John's friend is Shruti. So their Aadhar numbers will also be different. And this is Tanya's Aadhar number. This is Tanya's Aadhar number. Now this Aadhar number will be different for everyone. So John and Harry were friends. John's friend became Shruti. This is Tanya's Aadhar number. None of these four numbers are the same. If I told you any of these Aadhar numbers. I said 35, 44, 5. You will understand that we are talking about Harry. And if I said 54, 56, 56, 7. You will understand that we are talking about Shruti. And if I said 34, 56, 85, 68, 63. Then you will understand that we are talking about Tanya. So this Aadhar number uniquely identifies Tanya, Harry, Shruti. So what is this? This is their Aadhar number. This is their ID. No one else will get this Aadhar number. Okay. Along with that, Suppose John and Harry spent their childhood together. They both have big panties. And they studied in the same class. And the name of that class was class 10. Okay. Suppose they are in class 10. Okay. Suppose. What goes in believing? And Shruti is in class 9. And Tanya is also in class 9. Okay. So both are in class 9. Okay. Tanya is also in class 9. And Shruti is also in class 9. So what is Shruti's class? It is 9th. Tanya's class can also be 9. Shruti will not study alone in this class. Or Harry will not study alone in class 10. There are other children in the class. So the meaning of class is that In one class, there are Harry and John. So can a class be multiple of one person? A class can be multiple of one person. Like suppose Harry is in class 10. And he goes to a tuition where this class is in 10A. So there are classes in that tuition also. So there can be more than one class. One is class 10. And one is class 10A. And along with that, Suppose Harry wears a red T-shirt. So his class is also red. So the meaning of class is not the class to study. The meaning of class is that He has been classified in this class. Now come here. Leave this John, Harry, Shruti now. Okay. Delete it. I zoom out and delete it. Okay. It doesn't mean anything here. Now come to index.html and understand this. Suppose I made a div here. Okay. And I gave its class as red. Okay. And I made a span. And I gave its class as red. Okay. The classes I have given, Can I give them to different elements or same class? Yes, I can. But if I want to put ID in any element. Suppose I put its ID as first div. I can put anything in ID. So I can't give this ID to any other element. Because this is its Aadhaar card. This element. If that second div is also there, Then also I can't put it. Then also I have to put something else in ID. Okay. I put second div in ID. Okay. I write second and I will write first here. Okay. So this concept of ID and classes. I will tell you personally. I understood it very late. When I was learning Web Development in my early days. No one told me this. ID uniquely identifies an element. And the class. It can also put multiple classes in one element. And can also put the same class in multiple elements. Are you understanding? Like if I gave it a red class. I can also give it a BG yellow class. Okay. BG yellow. I can give this class. If we give a multiple class to any element. Then we put space. Like if I want. Multiple classes to be put in this element. Then what will I do? First I will write red here. Then I will put space and write BG yellow. So in this way I can give multiple classes. To the same element. Can I give multiple ID to the same element? Have you ever heard of someone's two Aadhaar cards? Brother, someone made it from here and there. I don't know brother. But there are no Aadhaar cards of Adality. Aadhaar number is one of a person. And Aadhaar numbers cannot be the same for different people. Okay. One person cannot have multiple. Different people cannot have the same. But the class. That is, if I say. What color do you wear a T-shirt? Or you can wear a red T-shirt. Five people can wear it. No problem. You will get it if you go on the road. And let's say you people. Those who like mango. Or those who like banana. Or those who like grapes. Multiple people will be found. So assume that in the banana class. Or they are in the grapes class. Okay. In the mango class. So we can classify in a class. And we can give different elements to the same class. So I hope you understood this thing. Now I will write a little CSS here. And don't say that brother. You are not reading CSS. And writing. What am I writing in CSS now? You people. I mean, just understand that. I am writing some alien language. Okay. Style. Inside CSS. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. And here is the preview of it. It is looking like this. First and second. I will show you just one thing. I am. There is a class. How do they target in CSS? By putting a dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID. Dot means class. Okay. If I say. The first div. Its background color. Do red. Okay. So by making the background color of the first div red. Its background color will be red. Okay. These are selectors in CSS. And now I am. I don't want to confuse you at all. And I can comment like this. In CSS. Okay. But all these things will come ahead. We will. Now what will I do by dotting red. I will write here. Background color red. And along with that. Dot bg. I will write. I will write. And along with that. Dot bg yellow. What will I do? Dot bg yellow. What will happen to me. I have to put a dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. Now I will make the background color. Yellow. Sorry. I will make it color red. I will not make the background color red. Dot red means. Its color should be red. So see its color is red. And the background color is yellow. So this way. You can use. IDN classes. In CSS. I hope. You must have understood this. Now one thing. It is very important to note here. That the IDN classes. They are attributes. In elements. So. These are the attributes of the element. This is the ID attribute. And this is the class attribute. So if I say. What are ID classes? Are they elements? No. They are attributes of elements. Now there is one more use of ID. I will tell you. What is another use of ID? If I take you to Wikipedia. And I write coding. So this page of Wikipedia has come. I will go to some other page. On some big page. So you see. When you go to Wikipedia. On any page. So what can you do? That. You can take the link of that particular place. I will show you how it happens. I go to some other page. I scroll down. I scroll down. I scroll down. I scroll down. I scroll down. I scroll down. And. Here I will inspect. I will see its ID. What is its ID? Okay. So I will copy its ID. Okay. And. If I put here. Hashtag. And this ID. Now if I hit enter. Then it will bring me straight here. In ICDA 8. So you see. If I put it in incognito. It will scroll me. And show that particular ID. You see. It will scroll. Instead of. Showing me this. It has shown me by scrolling. Because it wants to bring me to this ID. So it works in linking too. So that's the ID. Okay. Remember this too. Very few people will tell you. That you can generate links too. If you write hashtag in front of any link. And write ID. So when you open that link. It will focus that same ID. Like it is giving me in this case. You can see. As soon as I am hitting enter. So maybe I have done the wrong ID here. But you got the point. You got the point. Here 29.29. And I will hit enter. So you see. I have come down. If I open the incognito tab. Or if I reload it. So you see. I have come down. If I scroll it up. And after this. I open a new tab. And I will scroll. And I will scroll. And I will scroll. And I will scroll. And after this. I will open a new tab. And. I will do this. So you see. It is scrolling me. And bringing me to the same page. On which page this ID is. So I hope. You are understanding ID and classes. Through this video. ID means. Like Aadhar card. Class means. That one person's property. Like he likes red. Or in which class he is. One element. Can be given multiple classes. One element can be of red color. And its background can be yellow. And the other element. Its color can be red. And its background can be yellow. So red class. Can be applied to multiple elements. Red class. If you want. You can throw it. You can apply red class. To one element. And you can apply red class. To one element. And you can apply yellow class. So I hope. You are understanding. So that's all for this video. Guys. I was reading captions. And I laughed. While reading captions. So I told him. To name the village. And I laughed. 5-10 times. Very fast. I told him to access. Name your village. And my name. So on this. Access the playlist. Access the github. Like the video. And in the comment section. Write hashtag. Sigma batch op.
