Like it with high energy, guys. Because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come. A lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who don't know anything. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And my belief is that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you should learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment, man. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make you a lot of such websites so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. All right guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now as I am doing, you guys follow it as it is. I downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work, but you guys have to do exactly the same. As a beginner, what I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And with that, as the videos come, you guys will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly and I will write here that Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are here in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that particular operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this is the code that I have downloaded. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here and see here. I can double-click the setup of VS Code and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to the damages. And after this, I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Next, next, it is important to check both the icons here. It is very important to check both the icons. If you want a desktop shortcut, that is, if you want to get a shortcut in the desktop here, then click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will install it. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is a little slow, then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos, I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely, ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again that if you already know things, We are taking a beginner-friendly start here in the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. I will also request you to tell me in the comment section what is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section how much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner and you don't know what VS Code is, let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor which helps you to edit code. Now you will say that I can also edit code in Notepad. So yes, do it in Notepad. It will also happen in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will also happen in it. Let's set it up here and show what is there in it which makes it a little different from Notepad. Look here, let's set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. And I have done all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips for you. That's it. Your VS Code has started here. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see here that you can make a new file, you can make a new folder. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to name it, you guessed it right, Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand, we will do it related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows, then you can see here that an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. Now you will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say, Yes, I trust this file. Click here and say, Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. That is, if I click on plus, I will do something to make a new file. Suppose I wrote here index.html. Write now, even if you do not know what I am writing. Write, hit enter. And after that, what will I do? I will write here, Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means that you have not saved this file. Please save it. If you hit ctrl s, it will be saved. I will recommend you to go to the file and enable the auto save option here. So as you type, you will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly as you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise, if you want to save with ctrl s, then you can disable this option. I would like to do one more thing from you. Click here on gear, then click on settings. And search here mouse, mouse, mouse. Now see here, you editor, mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Just check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid at all. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is VS code? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this now. Now you will simply press ctrl and scroll like this. So what happens? Your font size changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. Here in downloads, in the folder named sigma web development course, what happened? That this file was made. Index.html Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. So because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this.txt. In that I write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. So this folder and this VS code are both running in sync. Now if I open this file from here with notepad. And I will show you that my file will open in notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use notepad. Because there are some things in VS code Which notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you that what is in VS code. Which you do not get in notepad. If I write here, Suppose if I hit enter html, Then it automatically gave me the opening closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template of html. If I click on it, Then see the basic code of html came here. We will discuss about it later. Now you do not get overwhelmed at all. But I want to tell you that How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use notepad and why we used VS code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. The developer's feel is coming. The hacker's feel is coming. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come to do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users, I want to comment here. Things are going to be exactly similar for you too. I am using windows because I have windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. I can't use Linux, Mac and Windows together. So things will be exactly the same for you. In fact, I should say that things will be similar. Not exactly the same, but things will be very similar. So you will be able to follow along very easily. So don't worry at all. I will tell you about some extensions in a while. And you will enjoy using those extensions. And you will also say that it is fun. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you that you will enjoy. Before that, I would like to tell you here. You will click on the right click command palette. So here are a lot of options for VS Code. You don't need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course, whatever feature will come in use as and when. I will keep telling you in a while. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So now see I will type anything. If I press caps lock, then caps lock will be clicked here. So you will know which button I pressed when. Now this thing is not at all relevant for you guys. But I just want to tell you that the screencast mode. The screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now here you see the vertical offset of the screencast mode. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset 0, then it came up. If I make vertical offset 70, then it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here, then it came here. If I make it 80, then it came here. That is, from bottom, how much will it look up? So I made it 0. In fact, I made it 1. Now I will type anything here. For example, I made it this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is I will close this this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like there are tabs in Chrome. These are exactly the same tabs. So I hope you know what it is. What we have written about it now. You will forget. I will tell you step by step what exactly is what. You can also close the welcome page of VS Code. By any chance, if you want to zoom in on VS Code, which I will do because I am recording a video. Now add control plus numpad plus. Look below, I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because I am recording videos. So ideally I would like you to see the screen from a distance. But when I am doing my coding, I don't zoom in so much. You have to keep this in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you how websites work. A website basically works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client brother. One is server brother. Who is the client brother? Who is the other one? Server brother. Who is the third one? Browser brother. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser brother. So browser brother, client brother, server brother. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You, all of us, who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will tell the client when I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what do I basically say? I say to this browser that please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here youtube.com I say give me youtube.com website. I say, Browser, give me youtube.com. I want to watch YouTube. What does the browser say? Do you want YouTube? Take this. So here I will enter youtube.com. So from the server it brought youtube.com. Are you understanding? From the server it brought youtube.com and it parsed it and showed me this screen. This work happened so fast because my internet.com is very internet.com, not internet.com internet speed is very fast. It is so low that people's speed is also fast. But still according to my locality it is very fast. So with this fast internet speed all these things are very fast. So client sends a request to server through browser. Browser is client's, means my assistant. It will do what I say from browser. It will help me to bring this webpage from server. Who is managing server? Server is managed by youtube. Youtube.com's server is being managed. And inside that server some code is written which sends me this kind of code. When I write youtube.com this code comes. Now how to convert this code into this this work is of browser. Means how to show me this work is of browser. So client says to browser something like this Hey kid give me youtube.com. Browser says Kid, you want youtube.com? Wait, I will ask youtube.com and bring youtube.com. Then browser goes to server. Means it sends a request to server. It says to server give me youtube.com. Server will either give it or will say it is not there. Or will say error. Or will say that server error happened. It was not found. Whatever response will be there ideally it should be 200. Response code is 200. With that response our browser comes back to client and shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client, browser, server. So client to browser browser to server and back to client. So this is how this works. This thing is a little more important. I will tell you once more. When you write google.com any website google.com So client says to browser bring me google.com. Browser says Hey teacher you want google.com? Wait, I will also bring it from server. So browser goes to server and brings google.com. And gives it to you. You get google.com. Now with google.com server sends all images all videos whatever things are there it sends all of them. Like these icons. It sends all of them. These icons' URL is also written in this code. And that also is the job of browser to display it properly. So the server sends a whole bundle to browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle and showing it like this is the job of browser. Now whatever interaction user will do with this page browser will ask additional request. If I right click and inspect and then go to network and here I write Harry bhai. I wrote harry bhai. So see so many requests it sent for images. And many more requests it sent. So as you interact similarly more requests additionally will have to be sent to browser. So in total you can consider it like a restaurant. You gave an order means you sent a request. As soon as you gave an order a waiter took your order. That waiter then went inside the kitchen. He sent your order to the kitchen. Consider kitchen as a server. And after this when the kitchen gave the order back then what did this waiter do? Which is the job of browser. That waiter gave you back the order. It is possible that that order cannot be made in the kitchen for any reason. It is very rare that you order something and you did not get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly, sometimes it happens here too that you get to see error. 404 error or 500 error. Server is not working. Such errors. Such errors are shown to you whenever you get to see them. But ideally 200 means OK response comes. And you get such a webpage. So you can consider it like a restaurant. So whenever you write google.com slash mail then if google.com slash mail is available then it will show you. And if you write codewithari.com slash contact then codewithari.com slash contact if it is available then it will show you. If it is not available then it will show 404. Or if there is 500 error then it will show you a page with 500. Whatever server it sends it will show you. So this cycle keeps on going. Client sent a request. Browser then sent a server. Server then processed the request. After this server sent data back to the browser. And whatever data it sent browser showed it to the client. Then client did something. Browser sent the same request to the server. Then server sent something. Whatever data server sent it came back to the client to the browser. And so on. So now you will say OK all this is fine but what is this backend? What is the meaning of backend? Backend is how server is processing the request. Now suppose you have a blog. Blog has a lot of data. So what will you do? You will store every webpage of the blog separately. Or you will dynamically generate that content. You will dynamically generate that content. I will take an example of Google. If I search Harry bhai here then you can see that the header of Google is this. Links are here. This format does not change at all. If I write here suppose Shubham. OK. Suppose I wrote Shubham. Now see when I wrote Harry bhai its very similar content is being shown to me by Google. So what does Google do? The backend of Google's server process the data in such a way that it can send this kind of HTML for the corresponding query. Means when I write Shubham then it will send this. When I write Harry bhai then it will send this. So the process of generating this thing is happening through the system that is the backend. Now this backend can be Django. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node.js. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. And the database inside the backend is used. Means the backend code is not visible to the client. This is the frontend code which is sent by the server. And how the server made this code we do not know. Because this code is running on the server. If you are getting confused then do not get confused at all. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend later. Now we understand how the frontend works. Now the frontend is primarily made up of three languages. The first language is the language which is made up of three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three languages are needed if you are making a website. Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript in most of the cases. If you use only HTML then it becomes a very basic skeleton of the website. After that when you use CSS then you can style it. Like the way this button looks like this it is visible only because of CSS. Along with that here this button is visible as red. Or the way this button is seen as curvy all this is happening because of CSS. The way the edges are visible all this is happening because of CSS. So CSS's job is to style a page. What will be the color of which button? What will happen if you hover over it? All these things are done through CSS. In a way CSS is the beauty of HTML page. HTML is the existence of any page. Consider it as a standard which is agreed upon. If you make any website then you will make it in HTML so that the browser makers can understand how to parse it. The job of the browser is to parse the HTML and HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Whoever will make a website in this world will make it in HTML and will use skeleton HTML. This is a standard. This standard is made so that everyone can make the same type of pages and if someone is making a browser then the same language has to be parsed. If as a beginner you have learnt 80% HTML then you are good to go for web development. Now, some things directly happen through HTML. For example, if I show you a very quick HTML code then I am writing HTML code in this way by hitting the exclamation mark I have used the Emmet abbreviation here. You don't have to worry about how I have written this code. I will write Hey, this is HTML and I can open this HTML file directly in this way and as soon as I open this HTML file directly here you will see it will open in this way. I can open it directly by double clicking here in this way and it has opened. Now see Hey, this is HTML is written but it is not styled at all. This HTML file is very basic. Now you can directly run videos from HTML. I have an HTML file which I will show you through which you can run videos. I will do one thing that I will show you this HTML file by changing it such that we can show videos in it. So, there is a video tag in HTML. If we hit enter then whatever video you put in SRC will be played. For example, if I put here video 1.mp4 now see VS Code has automatically shown me video 1.mp4. This is the benefit of using VS Code. I will reload it here. So, here this video is automatically shown. I can play it. To play it, I have to write controls here and I will refresh it now. So, I will get the controls to play. I can play. Now if I put video 2.mp4 here, I had put video 1 here. I have two more videos outside. I have some more videos here. I will show you some more videos. I will show you some more videos. I will show you some more videos. I will show you some more videos I have here. If I put it here and then I will refer them. If I put video 2.mp4 instead of it, then video 2 will be seen. I will reload it and show you. This is Ben Stokes' lookalike. Now if I make video 3 here, suppose I make video 3 here, then my third video will work. So, I will reload it and you see I can play it. Now, I can play video 2.mp4 and I can see the video 3.mp4 is playing. So, this is the third video that I have played. I will close it and similarly I can play video 4. I have a DJ video in which DJ is playing. So, you see. So, you can make such things only by using HTML. That is, you can make such things only by HTML. That is, you don't need to do anything else. You can play videos and images only by HTML. All this can be done only by HTML. Now, if you want to style it, suppose I want a border or a red background then what I have to do for it? For that, what will happen when I write code with Harry? For example, I wrote code with HR and autocomplete came here. Why did it come? It came because a request went to the server and for this query the results of autocomplete came here. So, all these things are done by JavaScript. We call it client-side scripting. That is, if we want to do scripting in the website, then we create a website called beauty with brain. I am talking about the website. Beauty with brain. I added beauty from CSS and brain came from JavaScript. Now, JavaScript helps you easily make the page dynamic. For example, if you want to change the content without loading the page, then you can do it by HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I was in college, so someone told me that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Learn HTML first, then learn CSS, then learn JavaScript. But, this is wrong. Why? Because HTML is only 80%, and CSS is 40%. So, I will tell you about the impact of chat gpt and web development. So, we will talk about this too. Stay tuned. So, don't run after perfection with HTML, CSS. Don't think that I will do HTML for 1 year, then CSS for next year, then JavaScript for the 3rd year, then your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, JavaScript. And you won't even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript while you are making money and working as a professional web developer. So, you are earning along with learning and improving your skills. So, don't think that I will make a website only if I remember all HTML tags, all CSS properties, all JavaScript. I will teach you only what matters. And I don't want you to learn only for years. That's why I designed this course like this so that you can learn only what matters. And you can learn other things from practice. I will teach you many practices in this course. Here, 2-4 mosquitoes have come to learn the Sigma web development course. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course, we will learn HTML, CSS, and CSS. I will tell you all these things in this course. I have learned some amazing tricks in my career very late. And I want you to learn all these tricks before starting. Now, if you have any doubt in this course in the coming videos, then you can use the hashtag doubt and ask your doubt. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try. I will try my best to answer all the questions. I will try to answer all the doubts. I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can. And you will learn everything in this course. So, like this course if you have not done it yet. That will bring a smile on my face. Now, what is React, what is Next.js, what is Angular? All these front-end frameworks help you use JavaScript properly. HTML, CSS, all these make a website. They help in making this process faster. How? We will learn it in this course. Yes, we will learn in this course. I told you that I will make this course for you completely different. I will make you from zero to a web development hero. You can buy a chair. Because you have bought a ticket to a train. That is JavaScript. Take a human as an example. The skeleton is HTML, then the skin, CSS, and the brain, the nervous system, is JavaScript. Now, I will take you to Forbes.com. As soon as you go to Forbes, a website has opened. Forbes.com is a website that uses HTML, CSS, and the brain. You can click on the right link, then the element opens. Now, look here, inside the head, they have used a script, and to add CSS they have used a link. So, I will remove their CSS from here. Now, I will delete all the stylesheets. Look at the page. It is just raw HTML. They have forgotten the size of images, and everything else. Only raw HTML is written here. So, Forbes.com is like this without CSS. Without CSS, it is just raw HTML. Now, if I delete the HTML tag, then it becomes a blank page. So, this is the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For your information, this course was initially made to be paid, but I changed my mood and converted it to a free course. I was thinking that this course should be free because when I used to learn web development, I could understand that you don't have a course to learn well and you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. So, I decided that this course should be free. This course is free, but as soon as you complete this course, you will earn a lot. So, I will tell you how you can earn money by completing this course. I will tell you everything about freelancing, how to get clients, and how to get a job. I will tell you some action items. First, bookmark the playlist of this course. Everyone can bookmark this playlist. Click on the star button and click on bookmark. Click on the save button. Now, you can buy the course even if it is paid. Thank you so much for all the support.
