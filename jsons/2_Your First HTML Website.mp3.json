Before moving forward in the video, I would like to tell you all that do access this playlist. Secondly, we are very close to 5 million subscribers. So if you have not yet hit the subscribe button, then do it. In today's video, we are going to make our first website as I have already told you. So the first thing we will do is create our VS Code. So first of all, we will create our VS Code. So first of all, we will create our VS Code. So first of all, we will create our VS Code. So first of all, we will create our VS Code. So the first thing we will do is customize our VS Code. So this is the folder where we started our web development series. Now I want to give you guys the source code of this web development series. So I will configure Git here. Now it is not necessary for you to know about Git. But I will fire the GitHub Desktop here. But I will fire the GitHub Desktop here. And here I will do what? I will add a new repository. I will click on Add. I will click on Create New Repository. I will name it Sigma Web Dev Codes. I will name it Sigma Web Dev Codes. And this is our folder. So I will select this folder. I will initialize this repository with readme. And I will write here, Source Code for Sigma Web Development Codes. I will click on Create Repository. By doing this, a repository will be created which is called Sigma Web Dev Codes. I will put all the things that were relevant from the first video here. So these two files were relevant from the first video. So I will name it Video 1. Right click, New Folder. I will make it Video 1. And I will move these two files to Video 1 folder. I am not pushing all these videos on Git. These are sample videos. You can use your sample videos. So now whatever the source code will be, I will keep updating it here. And I will keep pushing it on Git. Now how do we push it on Git? You don't need to learn this. But this procedure is very simple. Why do we use Git? I would like to tell you that Git is used by web developers. So you have to collaborate with other people. So what will happen is that you will work with many programmers. And those programmers will collaborate with your source code. And to do this kind of collaboration, they will also push some code. You will also push some code. Maybe one person is editing a file. Another person is editing another file. So GitHub is used here. And what is GitHub Desktop? GitHub Desktop is a utility to use Git. The difference between Git and GitHub is GitHub is an open source. But GitHub is a Microsoft-owned company. And by using Git, you can host repositories on your web interface. I will tell you more about Git in the coming videos. But I am pushing this repository on my codewithhari GitHub account. So you will get the link in the description. So as I give you links, you will get all the code. And I will talk about it later. I am making this video, the course, in fact, so that absolute beginners can follow it. So as soon as I click on the published repository, this code, this folder, will sync with my GitHub account. So all the code that I am going to upload here, it will go to my GitHub account and will keep syncing. The changes that will be here will be there. If someone has made changes there, I can pull it here by clicking here. I can pull it by doing fetch origin here. I will teach you all this. We will dedicate a whole video to Git. You don't worry at all. I did this thing so that I can give you code. I will go inside the editor, press shift right click and open with VS code. So here is open with code. You will get this option. If you have installed VS code as I told you, if you have made some changes and you have not checked the checkboxes that I showed you, then you may have a problem. So we will do this. Now whatever file I make here, like I will make index.html here, that file will be made here too. So everyone knows about this now. I know there are a lot of intermediate people here who already know about this. But I am making this course so that all beginners can follow along. So I will make three files here. One I made here index.html. The second file I am going to make is style.css. And the third file I am going to make is script.js. And the name of these files can be anything. But I just want to keep these files self-explanatory. By looking at their name, you will know what they are doing. Index.html is an HTML file. Script.js is a JavaScript file. Style.css is a style sheet. So I made these three files here. I will put an exclamation mark in index.html. And as soon as I put an exclamation mark, you see this code has come here. I will click on view word wrap so that you can see this code. The horizontal scroll bar moves away from the word wrap. I checked the word wrap here. So now you see here that we will understand this code. But for now, you understand that this code is HTML code. Let's use it to make a website. Now come to the next part of VS Code. Now come to the extensions tab of VS Code. Extensions are used to enhance the functionality of VS Code. We use extensions to make VS Code better. VS Code extensions help us write code. So which extension will we use? First of all, I will put some such extensions that our VS Code will be a killer. If your friends see it, they will say, what is he doing? So what I will do is VS Code icons. There is an extension called VS Code icons which I will install as soon as I do it. You will know that whatever file it is, its icon has come. You can see all these icons clearly here. Thanks for installing VS Code icons. I will activate it here. And here you can see that our icons are clearly visible. For example, if I make a folder, then this kind of icon will come. So these icons look good. And here there are a lot of good themes that you can use. There are some themes, one is Jellyfish theme, one is GitHub theme. But I can only put one theme at a time. This is the default VS Code theme which shows you VS Code in this way. Now if I change my theme, then my VS Code will look different. I will show you which one I will prefer when it comes to theme. First of all, I will show you GitHub theme in this way. So GitHub theme is an official theme provided by GitHub. Here you can see GitHub dark, GitHub light, GitHub dimmed, GitHub colorblind. I like this one a little better because the colors in it are sorry, I don't like this one. I will choose GitHub dark because the colors here are different. And the theme that is liked is Jellyfish. And many people like Jellyfish theme. If I install it, then your VS Code will look like this. Jellyfish will look like this. After this, there is a material theme, which is also very popular. And if I use material theme here, and there are material theme icons, we had to install this material theme. If you have installed material theme icons, then you can change your icons to control which extension. I will also tell you how to delete extensions. Here I am showing VS Code material theme icons in this way. And if you want, you can use VS Code icons. If I want the material theme icons to be removed, then I will simply remove it here. And all my extensions are visible here. Like material theme icon. And I want to use this one, so I will select it. And if I want, I can also uninstall it. And sometimes when I do anything, then reload is required. So I have to click on reload required. And when I click on reload required, then my VS Code will be reloaded. So you can customize your VS Code as you like. I will select my VS Code icons here, so that my icons look like this. I like this a little. I also like Jellyfish theme a lot. After this, there is another extension whose name is Prettier. I will not install it but I just want to tell you. There is another extension, ES7. When we react, you will know. We will react to this in this course. Sorry for the spoilers, but we are going to react in this course. So this is ES7 plus React Redux React Native Snippets extension, which gives you React snippets. We will use it when we react. For now, we will not install it. But now the most important extension is called Live Preview. We will install this extension called Live Preview. Because it is a very useful extension. All the extensions I told you, mostly help you to change the look and feel of VS Code. But the extension I am telling you today, Live Preview, will be actually useful to you. Let's come to our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. So here are our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This is the HTML file. These are some codes that tell the website how to look. Okay. So here I am saying that the title should have a document. I will write here, Harry's first website. Harry's course's first website. Harry's first website will be a lie. Your first website. You have to write your name in it. Okay. Whatever your name is. And if I write here in the body, Hey, this is my first website. And everyone write congratulations in the comment below. Everyone who has this first website, write it. Congratulations for my first website. And congratulate each other. Make the environment in the comment section. I also come in the comment section. And I give you all my heart. Hey, this is my website. Now let me see how it is. The biggest question that people have. So there are two ways to see. The extension we have installed, Live Preview. Live server used to run a lot, but Microsoft released the live preview. So the latest extension, I will recommend it. Live server also runs, but I am not going to run live server. I am going to use live preview. After installing live preview, you see this icon here. You are seeing above. If you click this, your website will look like this. Now you say that I want to see this website in the browser. Because my website will be seen in the browser. So if you want to see it in the browser, click here, open in browser, it will open in the browser. And let me tell you a fun thing. Listen to the fun thing too. You can close it from here and write here. Harry brother's course is good. Assume you have written. I am praising my course. But yes, Harry's course is good. I wrote it here. And you noticed one thing here. I did not reload the website at all. But even after that, he updated the content here, which I wrote in this VS code. That is, whatever I will write here, it will be updated here without reloading. Will it be done or not? Clap. What should be the clap for us? Okay, it will be done. And here, hey, this is my first website. Harry brother's course is good. Now I will write here. If Sigma Harry brother's course is good, Sigma Harry brother's course is good. Sigma Harry brother's course is good. Okay, so here you saw how this extension will help us. Even if you reload it, it will not make any difference because it is being reloaded live. Sometimes we want our page to be previewed here. I close it so that you can see the code. Sometimes we want our code to be seen here and there because we want to see its live preview. So assume I am writing anything here. Harry brother's course is good and this is Sigma course. And let's say I write something else here. I can write a lot of things here. So I will write here and I will keep watching here. And I can also make it small or big. So I will see the live update here. If you have ever seen my old videos, then I used this extension of the live server. Either this extension was not destroyed or I did not know. Whatever it is, it is fine. Now if something new comes, it takes time to find out. But this is something that you should use. I use this in my daily life. I do web development. Many people asked if you also do web development or just teach. I do it. I make websites. I don't just make videos. I also work by making websites. And yes, I also make good money by making websites. Now all this code that I am writing, you will get it all on GitHub. So you will go to the description of the video anytime. In any video, you will go to the description of any video in this course. So you will get the code of that corresponding video. You don't have to worry about that. Now I will close this because my preview is visible here. Now understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which we talked about. About which we talked so much in the last video. Now I will tell you how to link all three. Now you will say, yes, you have made index.html. It is very good. The title is also visible here. See the first website of Hari's course. Let's say I name it as Sigma Web Development course. So it will change. Sigma Sigma Web Development course. Here it is written as Sigma Web Development course and you can see here that it has been updated. So it will be updated. Live update will be done. Now I want my background to be red. Okay. Such things are done with CSS. So I can write here body and background color red. Okay. This is the syntax of CSS. I will teach CSS and I will teach it in such a way that you will not be able to forget it even if you want to. Don't take tension. What is written here? Now understand that this is CSS, which makes the color of the body red. Okay. And here you see that the color of the body will be red or not. Tell me in the comment section. Now I will tell the beginners that it will not be red. Okay. Why not? Beginners will think it will be red. But it will not be. There is not such a good world. This HTML file is running now. It does not know about this CSS file. Now what is going on in my house? What does my neighbor know? Now assume I have made lentils here and I expect that my neighbor has made rice. And suppose I expect that I eat it together. It does not happen. You can eat it sometimes. But you understand what I am saying. You have to link. You have to go and tell the neighbor that I am making lentils and you are making rice. There will be a handshake here. So how will that handshake happen? In HTML, you will tell where your CSS file is. So there is a link tag. And the reason not to use notepad will also be known here. As soon as I write a link here, see here link colon CSS. As soon as I select it, see here, it did half of my work. Wrote REL is equal to style change. I had to type this manually in notepad. I had to write this. But here it automatically came. Now style.css is my luck. Its name is also style.css. The file and here too style.css is given. If its name was harry.css, then I would have written harry.css here. And guess what? Here now my background has become red. Now if I want the color of my text to be white, then I can make the color text white here. I can write here color white. Now nothing will work here. I wrote color white. So see this is white. The valid CSS syntax will work. And we will talk about it later in this course. So this is our CSS. Now how will this JavaScript work? If I write here alert and I write here welcome to sigma web development course. Assume I wrote here welcome to sigma web development course. So what will happen? Will the alert come here? Why didn't the alert come? I will tell you that this syntax is absolutely correct. There is no problem in syntax. And I will also read JavaScript very well. So don't take this tension. What did you write? Assume this is JavaScript code which is on the screen welcome to sigma web development course. It will flash a very simple flash. Why didn't it flash? Has my computer gone bad? No, my computer is absolutely fine. I want to tell you that I will have to include the script. And let's include the script just before the body. Okay. Now as soon as I include the script here, I will write in src script.js. How did I write this? First of all I wrote here script. Okay. First of all I wrote here script. Emmet abbreviation. What is Emmet? Emmet is a plugin which is built in VS code. As you select it, your auto-complete will be done. Now if I am writing a script here and I am selecting colon src here, then it means that I want to give a source file. If you want, you can type it manually too. But the suggestions you are getting here make your writing skills faster. They make you a great developer. And increase your skills. So that you can not get into trouble. And as soon as possible, your as a developer can be self-sufficient. src is equal to script.js. You can see here. I have included it. Now I will come here. So you see, I have come here. Welcome to Sigma Web Development Course. Everyone write in the comment that I have become self-sufficient. Write. Because I know that your self-sufficiency has gone by seeing this box. JavaScript also worked. CSS was running. JavaScript also worked. Now your self-sufficiency has gone. I will reload it. It will come again. I will do OK. It will stop. So as soon as I visit this website, I will see an alert here. This is called an alert. I will tell you what is JavaScript. Don't say you didn't tell the alert. Don't start weirdly. I will finish HTML and then CSS and then JavaScript. So don't worry at all. And along with this, the best practices that I am telling you, you have to keep in mind. Because what I am telling you, it is coming from my experience. It is coming from a long time experience. And definitely it will help you. Like I said, live server. You can use it if you want. Nothing wrong in that. Use live preview from Microsoft. OK. Awesome. Now I want you all to write Sigma batch OP in the comment. If everyone is enjoying the course, then put Sigma batch OP in the comment. It will be fun to see. Yes, this is a batch. What happened if it is a free course? It is a batch. So write Sigma course OP with a hashtag. It will be fun. Now many people had a comment in the last video that how to do this mouse wheel. So you simply have to go to settings. Here you have to write mouse wheel. And here you have to check the editor mouse wheel zoom. Then by pressing the control, from the mouse wheel, I have pressed the control here. As soon as I do this, I will be able to zoom in. And if I do the command palette by right clicking here, then I can toggle the screencast mode here. Then whatever I will write here, you will get to see. I did not toggle the screencast mode in this video. Because you already know what I am typing. OK. So I can also toggle the screencast mode in this way. That is, I can turn it on. So that you can see all the things below that I am doing. In the last video, we talked about how websites work. And the thing we talked about, you understood very well. Now I will take the example of iPhone 15 Pro Max. And I will show you by ordering. How will the client-server interaction be? Whenever a user orders an iPhone. OK. So you will find it interesting. I will show you here. So guys, how does the website work here? I have come to explain on apple.com. Now see, apple.com is a website. OK. Data must have come from their server. OK. Whatever these HTML files are, I will click on pre-order here. And after that, I simply, when I am recording, it has not even come. By the way, he is saying that it will come by September. I will select 15 Pro Max. Let's take any color. Let's take black titanium. What is going on? Let's take 250 GB. Let's take no trade-in. No Apple coverage. After this, you see what they did here. Communication is going on with their server. It is going on. So in short, this is the HTML CSS JavaScript. You can see that I have sourced the view page here. So it is visible to me like this. And this is our original website, i.e. on which we were working. Now I will check out here quickly. I will continue as a guest. I will show you a fun thing. As soon as I click on inspect and click on network, you see 2 and 4 communication is going on with Apple's servers. Which means that here, as I am doing action here, JavaScript is communicating to the server and there, appropriate action server is taking and sending me data. I will say here, I would like to be delivered. Continue shipping address. I will put the name etc. It will deliver on 19th October. If shipping is coming, I will tell you. I will keep you updated. Okay? Yes, everything is fine. Terms and conditions. I read it. I totally agree. Place your order. I agreed. I placed your order. Like the video because I order iPhones to explain web development to you. Here it is. We have OTP. I will confirm OTP. And my purchase is done here. In total, I requested something from Apple.com server. I said, give me an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple.com said take it. So, this kind of communication between server and client is done through JavaScript without loading the page. Like you saw, I selected iPhone here. After that, I clicked on different things. So, how do all those things happen? They happen with the help of JavaScript. How is the styling? With the help of CSS. And everything written is HTML. I hope you remember this example. And if the phone comes, I will show you. Otherwise, many people will say that it is fake. I will show you when the phone comes. I will unbox it in front of you. So, this is how your websites work. How to communicate with client server. I hope you understood from this example. Tell me in the comment section if I want to give away this iPhone. What will be the best thing? So that you also know that I have done a genuine giveaway. Tell me in the comment section. I don't know about all this. If you have knowledge about this, then tell me. Now I want to tell you where you will get notes and cheat sheets. If you go to codewithali.com. You will get to see notes. And you can download notes here. Along with that, you will get to see cheat sheets below. For example, if I want to access the HTML cheat sheet, then I can access the cheat sheet here. There are all the elements here. But in this course, you guys stay, I will tell you about all the elements. Along with that, if you want to download my handwritten notes, then you can download PDF notes from here. I have written this handwritten. You will enjoy reading it. In this course, I will tell you everything. But if you download these notes, you will enjoy it even more. I will make your learning experience so good that you will also say that it was fun. Now I want all of you to do one thing. Put the initial review of this course in this first video. I want all of you to go to this video. And in this video, go to the comment section and post the initial review. I want you to write in the comment section below this first video that how did you like this course. And give me stars out of 5. Tell me by rating it star. I am talking about the initial review. I know that the course has not gone too far. But what quality and all these things, after seeing everything, I want to comment below in the first video. So if you do this work, I will like it from the heart. Go to the first video and rate this course. Now we will talk about how you can earn money after doing this course. So the first way to earn money from web development is very simple. You do freelance. Freelance as a web developer. You make websites. There are many websites that you can make. And by making them, you will get a lot of good money. Many people get APIs integrated. And by integrating APIs, many people earn a lot of good money. Many people say that chat gpt has come. Now chat gpt has come. Then nothing will happen. Everything is chat gpt. But this is not true. Making a website for you is easier. And when you use chat gpt, you become a giga chat developer. Music So use chat gpt as much as possible. And you can save your time. In fact, I tell the truth, since chat gpt has come, I have been able to deliver more to my freelancing clients. All the websites I had to make from the beginning, I do more than half of the work with chat gpt. And the work that chat gpt cannot do, I do it. Finally I do the package. And I don't have to answer anyone. What did I use from chat gpt? What did I do without chat gpt? You can do everything very easily. Use chat gpt. Chat gpt cannot do everything. You have to use chat gpt. And after that, you have to make a website and deliver it to the freelance client. Where will you get freelancing clients? You can go to a website like fiverr. Yes, I know that it is a little difficult to get work on fiverr. But you can go here in the buyer request. Fiverr has a buyer request option. Research it. If you go here, you can match with the buyer. If I show you images, then here is a buyer request. You can give your pitch to these people. I have done this thing and I have come to do this work. You will get work. It will start from here. As you get good reviews on your gig, you will earn more money. Suppose you have a gig on fiverr. No one has ever ordered on it. Then you will never get work easily. But if you have a gig, suppose 5-6 people have ordered and everyone gave you 5 stars. Then things get easier for you. Because the buyers want the credibility of the people they are getting work from to be good. Because they also need work. And they are also giving money. So their money should not be wasted. So here fiverr, upwork and many other freelancing websites on which you can try. But before trying, you should know how to make good websites. And today's date is responsive. Using cutting edge technologies. Suppose you want to integrate chat gpt api. You will get such work. No one will ask you to make a design. Or make a simple nav bar. I am saying that most of the clients do not do this work. You can make complex websites and earn more money. Then the second thing is get a job as a web developer. If you get a job as a web developer. If you become a good web developer, you will get a job. In fact, the demand for senior developers is increasing. And their backers are also increasing. People are earning more money in coding. If you are a basic developer, then chat gpt will replace you. After this, you can sell your services. By making an Instagram account. If you upload any kind of images on Instagram. And if you take a little bit of traction. Where you talk about websites. About all these things. Then clients start approaching you. Many clients approach me. They say that I want to make a website. I am not saying that you should have a lot of followers. You can start with very little following. After this, you can give people one to one help. You can give one to one help to people. You will get this from clients Instagram. Or from social media. You can say at the end of your reel. If you want to learn anything. Then you come to my DM. I will tell you. And you get clients very easily. Trust me if it helps you. After this, you can sell the course. I was going to sell this course. I have uploaded it for free. But this course was going to be paid by you. The truth is this. People pay for this course. It is not necessary that you have to make a course. There are many things in web development. How to use chat gpt api. Make a course of that. If you want to make a website. Then it will be easy for you to sell the course. The course economy is very huge. Many people contacted me. To buy this course. I will launch this course on their platform. But I did not do it. I wanted to give this course for free. I had decided. People contacted me till the last moment. Please do not put the course for free. But I put it. You have to write sigma batch op. You have to like it. Many course sellers have been harmed. Because when you get the iPhone 15, 16, 19, Who will ask blackberry? That too paid blackberry. I am saying this because. I have put a lot of effort in this. And I have put a lot of experience. I know that. You will also know in the coming videos. You will get a lot of things in this course. In the coming videos. I am aware of the fact that we are taking a slow start. But remember my words. We will raise the bar like anything. So access the playlist. Like the video. Thank you so much for watching this video. I will see you next time. Thank you."
