I am teaching web development using Sigma web development course, Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Semantic Tags  in HTML","number":"11","start":257.0,"end":258.0,"text":" What are semantic tags?"},{"title":"Semantic Tags  in HTML","number":"11","start":56.56,"end":59.8,"text":" To explain a little, I will tell you what are Semantic Tags?"},{"title":"Semantic Tags  in HTML","number":"11","start":40.36,"end":43.52,"text":" So guys, first of all, I would like to tell you what are Semantic Tags?"},{"title":"Semantic Tags  in HTML","number":"11","start":541.0,"end":543.0,"text":" That's why semantic tags are made."},{"title":"Semantic Tags  in HTML","number":"11","start":244.0,"end":245.0,"text":" Using semantic tags."}]
------------------------------------------------------
"where is semantic tag taught in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way(dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. if user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
